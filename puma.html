                <h2>Who are the Pumas?</h2>
                <p>puma, (Puma concolor), large brownish New World cat comparable in size to the jaguar—the only other large cat of the Western Hemisphere. The puma, a member of the family Felidae, has the widest distribution of any New World mammal, with a range extending from southeastern Alaska to southern Argentina and Chile. Pumas live in a variety of habitats, including desert scrub, chaparral, swamps, and forests, but they avoid agricultural areas, flatlands, and other habitats lacking cover (vegetative or topographic). Six subspecies of Puma concolor are recognized by most classifications.</p>

                <p>Pumas living near the Equator are generally smaller than those living farther north and south. Males in North America average 62 kg (136 pounds), but rare individuals can exceed 100 kg; length is about 1.2 metres (4 feet), excluding the 0.75-metre (2.5-foot) tail. Females are somewhat shorter and average about 42 kg. The specific name concolor (“of one colour”) refers to the puma’s fur, which is uniformly brown on the back, sides, limbs, and tail. (The name puma is a native Peruvian term.) The shade of brown varies geographically and seasonally from gray to reddish brown, and some black pumas have been reported; facial colour patterns are also variable. The underside is lighter. The long tail is commonly tipped with black and usually held close to the ground when the puma is walking.</p>

                <h2>Hunting</h2>
                <p>Prowling the rocky crags and forests, these agile, sharp-eyed cats are extremely proficient night hunters, with a highly developed sense of smell and hearing. These carnivores hunt animals both large and small, including birds such as lesser rheas and upland geese, small mammals such as rodents and hares, deer, and occasionally domestic livestock. The pumas favorite prey is guanacos, and being ambush predators, they stalk their victims before springing with a powerful leap and securing their meal with a fatal bite to the neck. Though pumas hunt alone, they have been recorded sharing kills with one another.</p>

                <p>Pumas hunt their prey during the nighttime. They’re eyes are specially adapted to help them see in the dark. After a cougar has eaten its fill, it will bury the remains of the kill and save it for a later date!</p>
                <p>What makes a Puma's hunting behavior so special?</p>
                <p><span>The jaw and teeth: </span>Pumas have strong jaws and fangs that they employ to deliver a lethal bite to the neck or throat of their victim. Their teeth are designed for piercing and slicing, and their jaw muscles may crush bones.</p>
                <p><span>Spine flexibility: </span>Pumas have a flexible spine that permits them to hunt in tight quarters and on tough terrain.</p>
                <p><span>Camouflage and Stealth: </span> Pumas have acquired natural stealth and camouflage, allowing them to blend in with their environment and avoid prey and predators.</span></p>
