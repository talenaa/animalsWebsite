                <h2>Who are the Pumas?</h2>
                <p>puma, (Puma concolor), large brownish New World cat comparable in size to the jaguar—the only other large cat of the Western Hemisphere. The puma, a member of the family Felidae, has the widest distribution of any New World mammal, with a range extending from southeastern Alaska to southern Argentina and Chile. Pumas live in a variety of habitats, including desert scrub, chaparral, swamps, and forests, but they avoid agricultural areas, flatlands, and other habitats lacking cover (vegetative or topographic). Six subspecies of Puma concolor are recognized by most classifications.</p>

                <p>Pumas living near the Equator are generally smaller than those living farther north and south. Males in North America average 62 kg (136 pounds), but rare individuals can exceed 100 kg; length is about 1.2 metres (4 feet), excluding the 0.75-metre (2.5-foot) tail. Females are somewhat shorter and average about 42 kg. The specific name concolor (“of one colour”) refers to the puma’s fur, which is uniformly brown on the back, sides, limbs, and tail. (The name puma is a native Peruvian term.) The shade of brown varies geographically and seasonally from gray to reddish brown, and some black pumas have been reported; facial colour patterns are also variable. The underside is lighter. The long tail is commonly tipped with black and usually held close to the ground when the puma is walking.</p>

                <h2>Geographic range</h2>
                <p>The puma is the terrestrial species with the widest geographical distribution in the Americas, occurring from Canada to Chile, including all of Brazil. It is one of the most well adapted cats in the new world, able to dwell in various types of environments throughout the continent.</p>

                <h2>Hunting</h2>
                <p>Prowling the rocky crags and forests, these agile, sharp-eyed cats are extremely proficient night hunters, with a highly developed sense of smell and hearing. These carnivores hunt animals both large and small, including birds such as lesser rheas and upland geese, small mammals such as rodents and hares, deer, and occasionally domestic livestock. The pumas favorite prey is guanacos, and being ambush predators, they stalk their victims before springing with a powerful leap and securing their meal with a fatal bite to the neck. Though pumas hunt alone, they have been recorded sharing kills with one another.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Pumas hunt their prey during the nighttime. Their eyes are specially adapted to help them see in the dark. After a cougar has eaten its fill, it will bury the remains of the kill and save it for a later date!</p>
                <p>What makes a Puma's hunting behavior so special?</p>
                <p><span>The jaw and teeth: </span>Pumas have strong jaws and fangs that they employ to deliver a lethal bite to the neck or throat of their victim. Their teeth are designed for piercing and slicing, and their jaw muscles may crush bones.</p>
                <p><span>Spine flexibility: </span>Pumas have a flexible spine that permits them to hunt in tight quarters and on tough terrain.</p>
                <p><span>Camouflage and Stealth: </span> Pumas have acquired natural stealth and camouflage, allowing them to blend in with their environment and avoid prey and predators.</span></p>

                <h2>Behavior</h2>
                <h1>Why Do Pumas Behave Significantly?</h1>
                <p>Pumas have been around the Americas for millions of years. And while they used to be found all over the place, their habits have decreased over time. Their significant behavior is essential for the survival and continuation of their breed.</p>

                <h2>Significance of Understanding the Diversified Behavior of Pumas</h2>
                <p>Like most wildlife, pumas have also been victims of various human activities. It is essential to maintain their population and diversity to sustain the ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Moreover, understanding their diverse behaviors help us to educate ourselves about their importance. As well as the need to be more cautious when preserving nature and wildlife.</p>
                <h2>Growing Habits: Structural & Physical Adaptations</h2>
                <p>From being a cub to their old age, Pumas grow various habits throughout their lifespan. Moreover, they sustain different physical adaptations as per their environment. Let’s check their growing-up habits!</p>
                <h2>Growing from cubs to adults</h2>
                <p>Like other cats, pumas go through various physical adaptations through different stages of their life!</p>
                <p><span>Cub: </span>Puma cubs are born blind and defenseless, with their eyes opening after around two weeks. They depend on their mother’s milk for sustenance and protection during this period. These cubs also have spotted coats that help them hide from predators.</p>

                    <img src="css/img/cub.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Kitten: </span>At this time, they start eating solid food and learning how to hunt from their mother. Their teeth begin to form, and they begin to investigate their environment. As kittens, pumas retain their spotted coat.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/pumakitten.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Juvenile: </span>At this stage, they begin to go out on their own and grow increasingly self-sufficient from their mother. They get adult teeth and their vision and hearing develop properly. Their spotted coat begins to diminish at this time, and they grow a more uniform coat color.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/youngpuma.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Sub-Adult: </span>Sub-adult pumas are still learning to hunt and are not completely self-sufficient. They keep growing and developing their adult coat, which is generally tawny or reddish-brown in color. Their tail lengthens and thickens, and they begin to acquire a more muscular body.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/subadult.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Adult: </span>Adult puma has completely perfected their hunting abilities and is self-sufficient. They are robust and athletic, having strong legs for sprinting and leaping. With the exception of mating and rearing pups, they are generally solitary creatures.</p>
