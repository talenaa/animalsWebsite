                <h1>Who are the Pumas?</h1>
                <p>puma, (Puma concolor), large brownish New World cat comparable in size to the jaguar—the only other large cat of the Western Hemisphere. The puma, a member of the family Felidae, has the widest distribution of any New World mammal, with a range extending from southeastern Alaska to southern Argentina and Chile. Pumas live in a variety of habitats, including desert scrub, chaparral, swamps, and forests, but they avoid agricultural areas, flatlands, and other habitats lacking cover (vegetative or topographic). Six subspecies of Puma concolor are recognized by most classifications.</p>

                </div>
                <p>Pumas living near the Equator are generally smaller than those living farther north and south. Males in North America average 62 kg (136 pounds), but rare individuals can exceed 100 kg; length is about 1.2 metres (4 feet), excluding the 0.75-metre (2.5-foot) tail. Females are somewhat shorter and average about 42 kg. The specific name concolor (“of one colour”) refers to the puma’s fur, which is uniformly brown on the back, sides, limbs, and tail. (The name puma is a native Peruvian term.) The shade of brown varies geographically and seasonally from gray to reddish brown, and some black pumas have been reported; facial colour patterns are also variable. The underside is lighter. The long tail is commonly tipped with black and usually held close to the ground when the puma is walking.</p>

                <h1>Geographic range</h1>
                <p>The puma is the terrestrial species with the widest geographical distribution in the Americas, occurring from Canada to Chile, including all of Brazil. It is one of the most well adapted cats in the new world, able to dwell in various types of environments throughout the continent.</p>

                <h1>Hunting</h1>
                <p>Prowling the rocky crags and forests, these agile, sharp-eyed cats are extremely proficient night hunters, with a highly developed sense of smell and hearing. These carnivores hunt animals both large and small, including birds such as lesser rheas and upland geese, small mammals such as rodents and hares, deer, and occasionally domestic livestock. The pumas favorite prey is guanacos, and being ambush predators, they stalk their victims before springing with a powerful leap and securing their meal with a fatal bite to the neck. Though pumas hunt alone, they have been recorded sharing kills with one another.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/huntingpuma.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>Pumas hunt their prey during the nighttime. Their eyes are specially adapted to help them see in the dark. After a cougar has eaten its fill, it will bury the remains of the kill and save it for a later date!</p>
                <p>What makes a Puma's hunting behavior so special?</p>
                <p><span>The jaw and teeth: </span>Pumas have strong jaws and fangs that they employ to deliver a lethal bite to the neck or throat of their victim. Their teeth are designed for piercing and slicing, and their jaw muscles may crush bones.</p>
                <p><span>Spine flexibility: </span>Pumas have a flexible spine that permits them to hunt in tight quarters and on tough terrain.</p>
                <p><span>Camouflage and Stealth: </span> Pumas have acquired natural stealth and camouflage, allowing them to blend in with their environment and avoid prey and predators.</span></p>

                <h1>Behavior</h1>
                <h2>Why Do Pumas Behave Significantly?</h2>
                <p>Pumas have been around the Americas for millions of years. And while they used to be found all over the place, their habits have decreased over time. Their significant behavior is essential for the survival and continuation of their breed.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/puma2.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Significance of Understanding the Diversified Behavior of Pumas</h2>
                <p>Like most wildlife, pumas have also been victims of various human activities. It is essential to maintain their population and diversity to sustain the ecosystem.</p>
                <p>Moreover, understanding their diverse behaviors help us to educate ourselves about their importance. As well as the need to be more cautious when preserving nature and wildlife.</p>
                <h2>Growing Habits: Structural & Physical Adaptations</h2>
                <p>From being a cub to their old age, Pumas grow various habits throughout their lifespan. Moreover, they sustain different physical adaptations as per their environment. Let’s check their growing-up habits!</p>
                <h2>Growing from cubs to adults</h2>
                <p>Like other cats, pumas go through various physical adaptations through different stages of their life!</p>
                <p><span>Cub: </span>Puma cubs are born blind and defenseless, with their eyes opening after around two weeks. They depend on their mother’s milk for sustenance and protection during this period. These cubs also have spotted coats that help them hide from predators.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/cub.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Kitten: </span>At this time, they start eating solid food and learning how to hunt from their mother. Their teeth begin to form, and they begin to investigate their environment. As kittens, pumas retain their spotted coat.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/pumakitten.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Juvenile: </span>At this stage, they begin to go out on their own and grow increasingly self-sufficient from their mother. They get adult teeth and their vision and hearing develop properly. Their spotted coat begins to diminish at this time, and they grow a more uniform coat color.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/youngpuma.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Sub-Adult: </span>Sub-adult pumas are still learning to hunt and are not completely self-sufficient. They keep growing and developing their adult coat, which is generally tawny or reddish-brown in color. Their tail lengthens and thickens, and they begin to acquire a more muscular body.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/subadult.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p><span>Adult: </span>Adult puma has completely perfected their hunting abilities and is self-sufficient. They are robust and athletic, having strong legs for sprinting and leaping. With the exception of mating and rearing pups, they are generally solitary creatures.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/adultpuma.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <h2>Social Behavior</h2>
                <p>Pumas, long known as solitary carnivores, are more social than previously thought, according to a study led by conservation organization Panthera and co-authored by UC Davis and the American Museum of Natural History.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/puma3.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>The study, published today in the journal Science Advances, is the first to quantify complex, enduring, and “friendly” interactions of these secretive animals, revealing a rich puma society far more tolerant and social than previously understood.</p>
                <p>"Our research shows that food sharing among this group of mountain lions is a social activity, which cannot be explained by ecological and biological factors alone," said co-author Mark Lubell, director of the UC Davis Center for Environmental Policy and Behavior. The findings may have implications for multiple species, including other wild cats around the world.</p>
                <p>“It’s the complete opposite of what we’ve been saying about pumas and solitary species for over 60 years,” said lead author Mark Elbroch, lead scientist with the Panthera Puma Program. “We were shocked. This research allows us to break down mythologies and question what we thought we knew.”</p>
                <h2>Not so lonely</h2>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/puma4.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>Pumas have been assumed to avoid each other, except during mating, territorial encounters, or when raising young. The population studied interacted every 11-12 days during winter. That is much less frequent than more gregarious species like meerkats, African lions, or wolves, which interact as often as every few minutes. To document social behavior, the scientists had to follow pumas over longer time spans.</p>
                <p>The team collected thousands of locations in northwest Wyoming from GPS-equipped collars and documented the social interactions of pumas over 1,000 prey carcasses. Of those studied, 242 were equipped with motion-triggered cameras that filmed interactions and served as evidence of social behavior.</p>
                <p>“Suddenly, I was able to see what was happening when these animals were coming together,” Elbroch said. “By stepping back, we captured the patterns of behavior that have no doubt been occurring among pumas all along.”</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/pumafamily.jpg" alt="">
                </div>
                <p>The research team analyzed puma networks to reveal that the species exhibits social strategies like more social animals, just over longer timescales.</p>
                <h2>Study Highlits on their social behavior</h2>
                <li class="li">Each puma shared food with another puma at least once during the study, and many of them ate with other pumas many times.</li>
                <li class="li">Choosing individuals to share meals with was not random or reserved for family members. The pumas seemed to recall who shared food with them in the past—and were 7.7 times more likely to share with those individuals. This is usually only documented with social animals.</li>
                <li class="li">Males and females likely benefit differently from social interactions. Males received more free meat than females, while females likely received social investments facilitating mating opportunities.</li>
                <li class="li">Territorial males acted like governors of fiefdoms, structuring how all pumas across the landscape interacted with each other. All pumas living inside each male territory typically formed a single network and were more likely to share their food with each other. Social interactions occurred across these borders, but much less frequently than among cats within the same male territory.</li>
                <h2>Loss of males disruptive to social network</h2>
                <p>The study emphasizes that puma populations are composed of numerous smaller communities ruled by territorial males. The loss of males, whether by natural or human causes, potentially disrupts the entire social network.</p>
                <p>Except for lions and cheetahs, whose males form long-term social groups, all wild cats are typically described as solitary — a strategy characteristic of species living in complex habitats where predators compete for dispersed prey. This study could encourage researchers to study the social behavior of other solitary carnivores.</p>
                <p>“This opens the door to enormous possibilities,” Elbroch said. “Are pumas everywhere behaving the same, or only in areas with large prey? Are other species like leopards and wolverines and so many others acting the same way? There is so much more to discover about the rich, secret social lives of wild creatures.”</p>

                <h1>Population status and Taxonomy</h1>
                <p>At the time of European settlement in the New World, pumas occupied all of what are today the lower 48 United States and southern Canada. At present they are primarily found west of 100° W longitude (approximately central Texas to Saskatchewan) except for southern Texas and are an endangered population in Florida (the Florida panther, P. concolor coryi). Information is lacking for Central and South America, although most suitable habitats there are thought to be inhabited. A subspecies known as the eastern cougar (P. concolor cougar), which once inhabited the eastern United States and southern Ontario and was listed as endangered in 1973, was declared extinct in 2011.</p>
                <div class="images">
                    <img src="css/img/floridapanther.jpg" alt="florida panther">
                </div>
                <p>Since 1950 pumas have been eliminated from the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Until the 1960s pumas were taken by U.S. government hunters and subject to state bounties. Since 1970 control efforts in the United States and Canada have focused on known livestock killers, and most states and provinces now manage populations for sustained sport hunting. In most of the western United States and Canada, populations of mountain lions (P. concolor concolor) are thought to be stable or increasing except where habitat is being fragmented by urban sprawl.</p>
                <p>Although cougars are elusive and usually avoid people, there are about four attacks and one fatality per year on humans in the United States and Canada. Most victims are children or adults traveling alone. Risk can be minimized by walking in groups and keeping children within sight. An aggressive human response can avert an impending attack and can repel an attack in progress.</p>
