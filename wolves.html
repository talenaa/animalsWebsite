                <h2>Who are the wolves?</h2>
                <p>Wolves (Canis lupus) are members of the Canidae family and can be found across the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often referred to as grey wolves, though there are many recognized subspecies, each with a unique name and found in different habitats. These include the Arctic wolf, the Arabian wolf, and the Iberian wolf. As highly social animals, wolves typically travel and hunt in packs of up to 30 members, targeting large herbivorous animals, such as moose, bison, elk, and oxen as prey. Each pack is led by a dominant alpha male and female. The male is responsible for guiding the pack in its travels, and the female is responsible for caring for and defending the pups.</p>
                <p>The dominant pair mate between February and April, with litters of up to five or six pups arriving in the spring. Male wolves weigh 30 to 80 kilograms (65 to 175 pounds) on average and are between 130 and 205 centimeters (4.3 to 6.9 feet) long. Females weigh 23 to 55 kilograms (50 to 120 pounds) and are usually around 20% smaller than males.Wolves are a keystone species and an apex predator in their ecosystems, meaning they help keep the number of prey species—and consequently the fauna and flora these species eat—in check. Because of their environmental importance, conservation and reintroduction projects are underway in certain areas where wolves have been hunted to near extinction.</p>

                <h2>Family</h2>
                <p>In this section we are going to talk about the packs (family group of wolves), here we'll have the following categories: What is a pack?, packs, why do they live in packs?, communication and the lone wolf.</p>
                <h2>What is a pack?</h2>
                <p>A pack is considered the fundamental unit of wolf social organization, and it is typically defined as a cohesive family unit that uses an established territory. For the purposes of annual population surveys, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife(WDFW) defines a wolf pack as two or more wolves traveling together in the winter.</p>
                <div class="packs">
                    <img src="css/img/wolfpack.jpg" alt="a pack of wolves">
                </div>
                <h2>Packs</h2>
                <p>A wolf pack is an exceedingly complex social unit—an extended family of parents, offspring, siblings, aunts, uncles, and sometimes dispersers from other packs. There are old wolves that need to be cared for, pups that need to be educated, and young adults that are beginning to assert themselves – all altering the dynamics of the pack.</p>
                <p>The job of maintaining order and cohesion falls largely to the alphas, also known as the breeding pair. Typically, there is only one breeding pair in a pack. They, especially the alpha female (the mother of the pack), are the glue keeping the pack together. The loss of a parent can have a devastating impact on social group cohesion. In small packs, human-caused mortality of the alpha female and/or the alpha male can cause the entire pack to dissolve.</p>
                <p>After the alphas, wolves second in command are called the betas, followed by mid-ranking wolves, and finally the omegas. Both mid- and low-ranking positions are somewhat fluid. Although an omega may hold that position for many years, it is not unheard of for the pack to pick a new omega and let the other retire.</p>
                <h2>Why do they live in packs?</h2>
                <p>Living in a pack not only facilitates the raising and feeding of pups, coordinated and collaborative hunting, and the defense of territory, it also allows for the formation of many unique emotional bonds between pack members, the foundation for cooperative living.</p>
                <p>Wolves care for each other as individuals. They form friendships and nurture their own sick and injured. Pack structure enables communication, the education of the young and the transfer of knowledge across generations. Wolves and other highly social animals have and pass on what can be best described as culture. A family group can persevere for several generations, even decades, carrying knowledge and information through the years, from generation to generation.</p>
                <p>Wolves play together into old age, they raise their young as a group, and they care for injured companions. When they lose a pack mate, there is evidence that they suffer and mourn that loss. When we look at wolves, we are looking at tribes—extended families, each with its own homeland, history, knowledge, and indeed, culture.</p>
                <div class="packs">
                    <img src="css/img/wolfpack1.jpg" alt="a pack of wolves">
                </div>
                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>Wolves communicate, collaborate and share knowledge across generations. The older wolves, as more experienced hunters, share hunting strategies and techniques with younger wolves, passing down knowledge from one generation to the next, maintaining a culture unique to that pack.</p>
                <p>The late biologist Gordon Haber observed wolves changing their hunting strategy based on weather, terrain, and prey behavior.</p>
                <h2>The lone wolf</h2>
                <p>We often hear the phrase “lone wolf,” an expression of grudging admiration. A lone wolf is often viewed as a rugged individualist, uncompromising and independent, driven to forge his own path, unfettered by the sentimental need for companionship. In reality, few people would ever want to live this way—and, as it turns out, few wolves would either. Wolves, males and females alike, may go through periods alone, but they’re not interested in lives of solitude. A lone wolf is a wolf that is searching, and what it seeks is another wolf. Everything in a wolf’s nature tells it to belong to something greater than itself: a pack. Like us, wolves form friendships and maintain lifelong bonds. They succeed by cooperating, and they struggle when they’re alone. Like us, wolves need one another.</p>

                <section class="section">
                    <h2>Hunting</h2>
                    <p>It is during a hunt where co-operation between wolves within a pack is most apparent. A wolf pack may trail a herd of elk, caribou or other large prey for days before making its move. During this time, they are already hunting, assessing the herd, looking for an animal that displays any sign of weakness, and this is just the beginning. Wolves must also factor in other conditions that will affect the hunt; weather and terrain can tip the scales in favor of predator or prey. For example, a wide-open plain favors the ungulates, who, if full-grown and healthy, can outrun the fastest wolf. On the other hand, crusty snow or ice favors the wolves whose wide round paws have evolved to perform like snowshoes and carry them effortlessly over the surface. An experienced wolf is well aware that hoofed animals break through the crust and can become bogged down in deep snow.</p>
                    <div class="hunting">
                        <img src="css/img/hunting.jpg" alt="wolves hunting an elk">
                    </div>
                    <p>Wolves have learned to use these conditions to their advantage. The late wolf biologist, Dr. Gordon Haber speaks of a particular pack in Alaska that he observed following a herd of caribou on a narrow packed trail through deep snow. The wolves know that their mere presence, following close behind, will eventually panic the caribou. When the rearmost caribou spooks, leaving the hard trail and attempting to run to the middle of the herd, it founders in the snowdrifts. When that happens it is all over. In warm weather, this same pack of wolves changes its tactics, herding the caribou into a dry riverbed where many of the ungulates stumble on the round stones.</p>
                    <p>A wolf pack therefore weighs many different factors when selecting its target and, as circumstances change during the hunt the target may change as well. Initially they may be pursuing a calf, but if a big healthy bull stumbles unexpectedly, they all know to go after the bigger meal. Conversely, if too many factors seem to favor the prey, they may choose to wait. Sometimes it is better to stay a bit hungry until the odds improve rather than expend precious energy on a fruitless chase.</p>
                    <p>Other observers of wolves have reported that often fewer than half of wolves on a hunt are actually involved with physically bringing down the prey. The youngest wolves frequently do nothing more than observe and learn from the sidelines. Each of the other pack members contributes according to its particular experience and ability. Speedy, lightly built females often take on herding roles, darting back and forth in front of prey, causing confusion and preventing escape. Slower but more powerful males are able to take down a large animal more aggressively and quickly.</p>
                    <p>Some of the wolves bad reputation stems from the apparent mob scene that ensues when the prey begins to falter. Wolves are not equipped to dispatch their victims quickly; prey usually die of shock, muscle damage or blood loss. If it can, one of the stronger wolves will seize the prey by the nose and hold on tight, helping to bring about a more expeditious end, but the animal can still take many minutes before it succumbs. Equipped only with feet for running and jaws for biting, wolves make the best of their limitations. A wolf pack’s ferocity and apparent brutality is really a defensive measure. It is not rare for a wolf to be seriously injured by flailing hooves and slashing antlers. A well-placed kick could break a wolf’s jaw, rendering it unable to feed itself. It is much safer to harass the prey and let it tire out before moving in close. Far from being a mob scene, a hunt is a masterfully coordinated group effort, well deserving of our admiration.</p>
                    <p>Although the alpha male is usually in the thick of the hunt, it would be an exaggeration to say that he is leading it. The alpha may select the animal to be pursued, or he may chose to break off the hunt if it is going poorly. But he is not barking out orders to his subordinates like a general on the battlefield. The wolves just seem to know what to do, and they do it as one.</p>
                    <p>The young wolves watch the behavior of the adults and see how the game is played. They witness how the adults change their strategy according to conditions and type of prey. They learn how the hunters handle each different situation: what to do when the prey dashes for open ground, or jumps into a river, or turns to defend itself.</p>
                    <p>When juvenile wolves finally join in the hunt, they imitate the more experienced wolves and perfect the precise skills of herding and tackling. By the time they are full grown adults, they have become part of a well-oiled machine. Even if they were able to communicate verbally with each other during the hunt, it would be unnecessary. They know exactly what to expect from the others and what is expected of them.</p>
                    <h2>Predator and Prey</h2>
                    <p>What the wolf lacks in size, power and weapons it makes up for with collaboration and intelligence. Smaller and less powerful than mountain lions, for example, wolves work together to take down prey much larger than an individual wolf; prey that may otherwise elude them. While individual wolves have been able to subdue large prey animals, their advantage is in collaborating with their pack.</p>
                    <p>Wolves are opportunists. They test their prey, sensing any weakness or vulnerability through visual cues and even through hearing and scent. Contrary to ambush predators that rely on the element of surprise and a short and intense burst of energy to secure their prey, wolves are endurance or coursing predators. They chase their prey, often over longer distances, sometimes even a few miles, in order to find the right animal or opportunity. On the hunt, wolves work together with certain individuals typically carrying out their specific role in the hunt, often based on age, gender and social standing.</p>
                    <p>While wolves will eat hares and other small prey, their preferred targets are ungulates, large hoofed animals such as deer and elk. Individual packs will specialize in hunting specific prey species. While most often that is elk, caribou, deer and moose, it can also be bison, muskoxen, dall sheep or even salmon.</p>
                    <p>It is not uncommon for wolves to be injured or even killed during the hunt by being kicked by a hoof or gored by an antler. Most often the prey they select is in some way weaker and/or more vulnerable than the other animals in the herd. They may be injured, sick, old, very young or genetically inferior. But even healthier animals can at times find themselves in a vulnerable position. Over time this process allows the most capable prey animals to survive and pass on their genes and it helps to limit the spread of diseases within the herd. This is an ancient evolutionary success story shared by both predator and prey.</p>

                    <h2>Where do wolves live?</h2>
                    <p>The grey wolf was once the most widely distributed mammal in the world, but its range today is 30% smaller than it once was. Wolves could previously be found throughout the Northern Hemisphere, but extensive and widespread eradication left them extinct in much of western Europe, Mexico, and the US. Wolves have gone extinct in some countries, such as Japan.</p>
                    <p>Wolves are now primarily found in the remote wilderness of the Northern Hemisphere, predominantly in Canada, Alaska, Europe, and Asia. Thanks to their varied diet—ranging from moose and wild boar to smaller prey like carrion and even domestic rubbish in urban areas—they can live in a range of habitats, including forests, shrublands, wetlands, grasslands, rocky areas, and deserts.</p>

                    <h2>Species</h2>
                    <p>There are two widely recognized species of wolves in the world, the red and the gray. However, there is debate over how many species of wolf exist and if there are different subspecies of the gray wolf. Additionally, there is a little-known canid, which lives in the Ethiopian highlands called Canis simensis that is thought to be a very close relative of the wolf.</p>
                    <p>The canid family consists of thirty-five living species. Eight of these species inhabit North America. These North American species include gray wolves, red wolves, coyotes, red foxes, gray foxes, kit foxes, swift foxes and arctic foxes. The eight species may be organized in three general categories: wolves, coyotes and foxes.</p>
                    <p>We are going to talk about some species and their description, range, behaviour, diet, life history, and conservation.</p>

                                <h2><em>Canis Lupus</em></h2>
                                <div class="status">Status: Least concern</div>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Gray wolves, or timber wolves, are canines with long bushy tails that are often black-tipped. Their coat color is typically a mix of gray and brown with buffy facial markings and undersides, but the color can vary from solid white to brown or black. Gray wolves look somewhat like a large German shepherd. Wolves vary in size depending on where they live. Wolves in the north are usually larger than those in the south. The average size of a wolf's body is three to five feet long and their tails are usually one to two feet long. Females typically weigh 60 to 100 pounds, and males weigh 70 to 145 pounds.</p>
                    <h3>Range</h3>
                    <p>The historic range of the gray wolf covered over two-thirds of the United States. Today gray wolves have populations in Alaska, northern Michigan, northern Wisconsin, western Montana, northern Idaho, northeast Oregon, and the Yellowstone area of Wyoming. Mexican wolves, a subspecies of the gray wolf, were reintroduced to protected parkland in eastern Arizona and southwest New Mexico. Wolves can thrive in a diversity of habitats from the tundra to woodlands, forests, grasslands and deserts.</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Wolves communicate through body language, scent marking, barking, growling, and howling. Much of their communication is about reinforcing the social hierarchy of the pack. When a wolf wants to show that it is submissive to another wolf, it will crouch, whimper, tuck in its tail, lick the other wolf's mouth, or roll over on its back. When a wolf wants to challenge another wolf, it will growl or lay its ears back on its head. A playful wolf dances and bows. Barking is used as a warning, and howling is for long-distance communication to pull a pack back together and to keep strangers away.</p>
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p>Wolves are carnivores—they prefer to eat large hoofed mammals such as deer, elk, bison, and moose. They also hunt smaller mammals such as beavers, rodents, and hares. Adults can eat 20 pounds of meat in a single meal.</p>
                    <h3>Life history</h3>
                    <p>Wolves live in packs. Most packs have four to nine members, but the size can range from as few as two wolves to as many as 15. Occasionally a pack can increase to 30 members, until some individuals break off to find new territory and form their own pack. Within the pack hierarchy, there are male and female hierarchies. The alpha male is dominant over the entire pack, both males and females. The alpha female and male are the only ones that breed. When the young adults reach the age of three, they can either join the pack or leave to find their own territory. The new territory can be close by if there is a lot of prey. In some areas, young adults travel hundreds of miles to find a new territory.</p>
                    <p>Wolves typically mate for life. In the northern United States, they breed from late January through March. The breeding season is earlier for wolves living farther south. Wolves are pregnant for about 63 days and usually birth four to six pups. The wolf pups are usually born in a den. At birth, they cannot see or hear and weigh about one pound. The pups are weaned at about six weeks. Adult pack members swallow meat and bring it back to the den for their pups. After the adults regurgitate the food, the pups have a hearty meal. The mother wolf moves her pups to new den sites every couple of months until the fall, when the pack stops living at den sites. In the wild, wolves live 8 to 13 years, sometimes more. In captivity, they live upward of 15 years.</p>
                    <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>The gray wolf's story is one of the most compelling tales of American wildlife. Once, the wolf was widespread across most of North America, but it was hunted ruthlessly and extirpated over most of its range. Today the wolf is making a successful comeback in some of its former habitat due to strong conservation efforts. The gray wolf plays a vital role in the health and proper functioning of ecosystems.</p>

                                <h2><em>Canis Lycaon</em></h2>

                    </div>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>The eastern wolf is slightly smaller than the common gray wolf and leaner, giving it the silhouette of a coyote. Its coat is a slightly pale grayish brown and the back and flanks are covered with long black hairs. It has a slightly reddish spot behind the ears, which would suggest an ancestry with the red wolf.</p>
                    <h3>Range</h3>
                    <p>Has a restricted range, limited to south-central Ontario and south-central Quebec.</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>The Canius Lycaon has a similar behavior to the gray wolf. They live in a family pack on a territory capable of providing them with the necessary amount of food. Their vocalizations and gestures allow them to interact with their fellow wolves, and procreation is only allowed for the alpha male and female. There are also bonds of domination and submission between members of the group.</p>
                    <p>Like the gray wolf, the Eastern wolf also communicates by secreting odorous substances at the base of its hair, on its legs and on its tail thanks to their scent gland.</p>
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p>Smaller than the gray wolf, the eastern wolf feeds mainly on deer and rodents: beavers, muskrats, and birds. It does not prey on large mammals such as elk or moose.</p>
                    <h3>Life History</h3>
                    <p>The breeding period takes place at the end of winter, and the female gives birth in her den between March and June, after a gestation period of two months. The litters are usually five or six pups that are born blind. They regain their sight after about twelve days.</p>
                    <p>The young are weaned after two months of breastfeeding. They are then fed regurgitated meat by both parents.</p>
                    <p>Around 4 months, the cubs have learned the rules of the pack and accompany the adults on the hunt. Sexual maturity occurs after two years on average.</p>
                    <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>It is difficult to estimate actual eastern wolf populations in the upper Great Lakes because they hybridize easily with coyotes. This fact represents a danger for the preservation of the original strain. The wolf and the coyote are so similar that the Canadian government has instituted a hunting ban for all wolves in Canada, as well as for coyotes to avoid accidental shooting. The canine is also a victim of human pressure: road accidents, agricultural development, mining operations.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Red Wolves are lean canids, often with black-tipped bushy tails. Their coats are mostly a brown or buff color, with some black along their backs. There is sometimes a reddish tint to the fur on their muzzle, behind their ears, and on the backs of their legs. The Red Wolf is between the size of a gray wolf and a coyote. They are about four feet long and stand about 26 inches at the shoulder. Red Wolves weigh anywhere between 45 and 80 pounds, with males averaging about 60 pounds and females about 50 pounds.</p>
                    <h3>Range</h3>
                    <p>Historically the Red Wolf ranged from southeastern Texas to central Pennsylvania. Today the only place Red Wolves can be found in the wild is in eastern North Carolina's Albemarle Peninsula. Equally at home in forests, swamps, and coastal prairies, Red Wolves can thrive in a wide range of habitats and are known as habitat generalists.</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Red wolves are social animals that live in close-knit packs. Typical packs consist of a family group that is comprised of five to eight animals, including a breeding adult pair and their offspring of different years. Older offspring will often assist the breeding pair in pup rearing.</p>
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p>Red Wolves are carnivores, though their diet can vary depending on what prey is available. Mostly they hunt smaller mammals like raccoons, rabbits, and rodents, along with white-tailed deer. Within their territory, Red Wolves will travel up to 20 miles in search of prey.</p>
                    <h3>Life history</h3>
                    <p>Red Wolves mate for life, and each pack is formed around the breeding pair. Usually Red Wolves form a group of five to eight, composed of the breeding male and female and their offspring from different years. The pack is a very close family unit. Older offspring will help the breeding male and female raise their younger siblings, and will also attend the den. Within one to three years, the younger Red Wolves will leave the pack in search of their own mates and territory.</p>
                    <p>Each pack has its own home range, which the Red Wolves will hunt in and defend from other canids. Red Wolves are fiercely territorial creatures and will even fight other Red Wolves if needed. Red Wolves breed once a year, from January through March. Anywhere from one to nine pups are born roughly nine weeks later in April or May. After about 10 days, the pups' eyes open. For several weeks after this period, the other members of the pack keep a close eye on the pups, keeping them within the den until they mature. The dens themselves are well hidden near stream banks, downed logs, sand knolls, or even drain pipes and culverts. The adult pack members will range and return with food for the pups until they are strong enough.</p>
                    <p>The average Red Wolf life span is 7-9 years, but their life expectancy drops to roughly 2-3 years in the wild when considering human-based mortalities (gunshots and vehicle strikes). The oldest known Red Wolf in the wild was actually 14 (1743F, who passed away in 2023).</p>
                    <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Smaller and ruddier in color than their gray wolf cousins, the Red Wolf is one of the most endangered canids in the world. Though Red Wolves once ranged across the southeastern United States, years of hunting and habitat loss drove the species to the brink of extinction in the 1970s. Red Wolves were officially declared extinct in the wild in 1980, but due to the efforts of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which captured the remaining 14 wild Red Wolves and started a captive breeding program, the species became the first animal to be successfully reintroduced after being declared extinct in the wild. The captured Red Wolves are the direct ancestors of the animals that now live in North Carolina.</p>
                    <p>Within their ecosystem, the Red Wolves play a valuable role in keeping numbers of prey like deer in check. In turn the smaller prey populations are less likely to balloon out of control and consume all available nutrients in their habitat. Additionally, the Red Wolves’ diet includes the invasive nutria and nuisance animals like raccoons.</p>
                    <p>Though the Red Wolf has come a long way, there are many threats to the species in the long-term including hybridization with coyotes. The smaller coyotes do not pose a direct challenge to Red Wolf territory and, in fact, are displaced and removed from the environment if there is a Red Wolf Pack in a given territory range, but when low in their population numbers, Red Wolves tolerate coyotes due to the lack of ability to form breeding pairs with other Red Wolves. Any offspring between coyotes and Red Wolves endangers the Red Wolf species as an entirety by potentially wiping them out with hybrid animals. This endangers the genetic diversity of the species as a whole, which the captive breeding program has carefully cultivated to limit the risk of morphological and physiological problems that can occur with low genetic diversity. Thankfully management actions by wildlife managers, such as sterilizing territorial coyotes, are limiting hybridizations events and reducing the density of coyotes around the wild Red Wolf population. This gives Red Wolves the opportunity to increase their numbers to the point where they can easily displace coyotes and regularly find Red Wolf mates.</p>
                    <p>Human-caused events also pose an existential risk to the Red Wolf. Though shy by nature and avoidant of humans, further development and habitat fragmentation increases the chance of interaction between the two species. In fact, human-caused mortality events, specifically gunshots and vehicle strikes, are the leading cause of death and population decline amongst wild Red Wolves. Furthermore, their entire habitat in the Albemarle Peninsula rests just three feet above sea level, and as a result climate change also poses a serious threat.</p>

                                <h1>Ethiopian Wolf</h1>
                                <h2><em>Canis Simensis</em></h2>
                                <div class="status">Status: Endangered</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Native to Ethiopia, these long-limbed, slender canids are some of the most endangered animals in Africa. They have a black, bushy tail that can reach up to 40 centimeters in length, pointed ears, and a slender snout. They are tawny red with a white underbelly and blaze on their chests, and also have white fur on their throats, which sweeps up and covers the underside of their muzzle. The female wolves tend to be paler in color than males and are smaller overall.</p>
                    <h3>Range</h3>
                    <p>The Ethiopian wolf has a very restricted range. It is found only in six or seven mountain ranges of Ethiopia. This includes the Arssi and Bale mountains of southeast Ethiopia, the Simien mountains, northeast Shoa, Gojjam, and Mt. Guna (Ginsberg and Macdonald 1990).</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>With a family-oriented behavior, ethiopian wolves packs are groups of extended family members, made up of all the males born into the pack during the previous years and one or two females. During breeding season, commingling between different parks is more common due to habitat saturation and the high potential for inbreeding inside the closely related pack. These interactions are highly vocal, and end when the smaller pack flees from the larger one.</p>
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p>Ethiopian wolves live together, but hunt alone. Unlike other wolf species, the Ethiopian wolf is a solitary hunter. Ethiopian wolf diet consists mainly of the giant mole rats and common grass rats that are abundant in their habitat. On the rare occasion, these canids will hunt cooperatively to bring down young antelopes, lambs, and hares. However, Ethiopian wolves are social animals and form packs of three to 13 individuals — this allows them to defend a territory with enough rodents to feed the entire group.</p>
                    <h3>Life history</h3>
                    <p>Once a year between October and January, the dominant female in each pack gives birth to a litter of 2-6 pups. Gestation lasts approximately 60-62 days. The female gives birth to her litter in a den she digs in open ground under a boulder or in a rocky crevice. The pups are born with their eyes closed and no teeth. They are charcoal gray with a buff patch on their chest and under areas. At about 3 weeks, the coat begins to be replaced by the normal adult coloring and the young first emerge from the den. After this time, den sites are regularly shifted, sometimes up to 1300m.</p>
                    <p>The development of the young occurs in three stages (Sillero-Zubiri and Gottelli 1994). The first covers weeks 1-4 when the pups are completely dependent on their mother for milk. The second occurs from week 5-10 from when the pups' milk diet is supplemented by solid food regurgitated from all pack members. It ends when the pups are completely weaned. Finally, from week 10 until about 6 months, the young survive almost solely on solid food provided from adult members of the pack. Adults have been seen providing food for young up to 1 year old. The Ethiopian wolf attains full adult appearance at 2 years of age, and both sexes are sexually mature during their second year (Sillero-Zubiri and Gottelli 1994). Data on life expectancy is inadequate, but C. simensis is likely to live 8-9 years in the wild</p>
                    <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Natural causes of mortality include predation of young by spotted hyenas or raptors, starvation in juveniles occurring more frequently with females, pathogens and parasites such as rabies which is the main cause in Bale, and human causes.</p>
                    <p>The Ethiopian wolf is considered a critically rare canid and one of the rarest African carnivores. Population decline is a result of many factors: continuous loss of habitat due to agriculture (sustenance farming and overgrazing), traffic incidents and shootings, hybridization with domestic dogs, and disease. The Ethiopian wolf receives full official protection under Ethiopia’s Wildlife Conservation Regulations of 1974, Schedule VI. Killing of a wolf carries a sentence of up to two years imprisonment.</p>
                    <p>Conservation efforts include vaccination of both domestic dogs and wild wolves from rabies, sterilization of domestic dogs and hybrids, funding patrolling and maintenance of recovery areas, surveys and monitoring of populations, workshops to educate about Ethiopian wolves, the Bale Mountains Research Project begun in 1983, and the establishment of the Ethiopian Wolf Conservation Programme (EWCP) in 1995. There are no Ethiopian wolves in captivity.</p>

                    <h2>Who are the Coyotes?</h2>
                    <p>Coyotes are members of the dog family, also known as Canidae. Thanks to their highly adaptable nature, they can be found in various ecosystems spread across North America. Their habitats range from forests and grasslands to deserts and even urban areas.</p>
                    <p>The coyote is characterized by its long, coarse, greyish-brown fur with a lighter underside, as well as a bushy tail, erect and pointed ears, and a long, slender snout. Compared to wolves, coyotes are medium-sized canids with a smaller size and lighter build. A coyote is typically around 60 centimeters (2 feet) tall and up to 1.3 meters (3.3-4.2 feet) long, including a 30- to 40-centimeter (11- to 15-inch) tail. Coyotes’ size and color can vary depending on the region in which they live. They can weigh anywhere from nine to 23 kilograms (20 to 50 pounds), with the largest coyotes residing in the northeast US and eastern Canada.</p>

                    <h2>Their packs</h2>
                    <p>A coyote pack is a family group – or a reproductive group. Coyotes are social animals that often live in packs. They often hunt and rear pups cooperatively. The pack is dominated by two breeding animals: the alpha male and female. Other members of the pack can include one or more pups from a prior year, animals from other packs that have been accepted, and puppies from the current year. The alpha male and female are the dominant animals in the group and patrol the same territory. Others in the pack are subordinate to the alpha pair. Subordinate pack members often care for the young of the year. Others help hunt for food.</p>

                    </div>
                    <h2>Communication</h2>
                    <p>Howling, barking and other vocalizations as well as body language aren't the only ways coyotes communicate. They also urinate on trees, bushes, rocks, posts and other structures and leave behind their scat as a way to mark territory and alert other coyotes to their presence, IDNR (Illinois Department of Natural Resources) reports.</p>
                    <h2>Solitary Coyotes</h2>
                    <p>In addition to resident packs, the urban population also consists of solitary coyotes that have left packs and are looking to join groups or create their own territories. Between one-third and one-half of the coyotes studied each year are solitary animals. They can be either males or females and are usually young coyotes (six months to two years old) but can also be older individuals who have left packs. Solitary coyotes travel over large areas, up to 60 square miles covering many different municipalities; some coyotes may even disperse to different states. These animals must travel between and through, resident coyote territories. Read the story about coyote 571 for an example of this coyote social class.</p>
                    <p>If a coyote is seen running across a field, it is impossible to know if it is a solitary coyote or a member of a pack from that sighting.</p>

                    <h2>Hunting</h2>
                    <p>Coyotes are proficient hunters. When they run, their tails point downwards, and they can reach speeds of up to 64 kilometers per hour (40 miles per hour). In open spaces, they rely on sight, but where prey may be hiding in a forest or thick vegetation, they will use their keen senses of smell and hearing. Coyotes have opportunistic hunting habits, and they typically hunt as individuals rather than in groups. Their diverse diet consists primarily of mammals, such as deer and rabbits, but may also include frogs, fish, and other prey, as well as fruits, grass, insects, and carrion.</p>

                    <p>As indicated above, coyotes are not picky eaters. They will eat just about anything they find. Having such a wide ranged diet, it allows them to thrive almost anywhere.</p>

                    <h2>Where do coyotes live?</h2>
                    <p>Coyotes were originally found in arid areas of the US, Canada, and Mexico, within prairies, deserts, and open forests. However, coyotes have expanded their range due to a variety of factors, including human activity, habitat alteration, and a decline in the populations of their natural predators.</p>
                    <p>As highly adaptable creatures, coyotes are now widely distributed across North and Central America. They’ve even been observed near the border of South America. They live in coniferous and deciduous forests, grasslands and prairies, deserts, and urban and suburban areas.</p>

                    <h2>Species</h2>
                    <p>Coyotes are very prominent members of the canine family having many other known wild animals like foxes, wolves, and dogs. You can find traces of the Coyotes from Northern Canada to the central and southern sides of America. Owing to the widespread territorial range, there are almost 19 subspecies of Coyotes throughout the North American continent. These subspecies have differences on the basis of home range and genetics. They are very less in number in South America due to the Darien Gap effect. Overall, they have a very stable population throughout the continent.</p>
                    <p>There are a total of 19 coyote species that you can find on the American continent. Twelve of them lie in the North American region while seven of them lie in Central America. Among these coyotes, the largest size coyotes could be witnessed in the Southeastern side of the USA.</p>

                    <h3>Description</h3>
                    <p>Coyotes are medium in size. They have pointed muzzles and long, brushy tails. Their coats are usually a mixture of tan, black, and gray, but can range from black to strawberry blond. The average Eastern adult coyote weighs 30 to 35 pounds, with males being heavier than females.</p>
                    <h3>Range</h3>
                    <p>Coyotes are widely distributed throughout the USA, southern and south-central Canada, and south through Mexico into northern Central America. The northward and eastward expansions of coyote range may have been the result of wolf removal since their range is expanding in areas where wolves were eliminated.</p>
                    <h3>Behavior</h3>
                    <p>Coyotes are very social animals, they do not form packs but rather live in family groups. They will usually travel and hunt alone but sometimes join in loose pairs to take down prey. As a testament to the their adaptability, coyotes have been known to even hunt cooperatively with other species.</p>
                    <h3>Diet</h3>
                    <p>Coyotes are opportunists, both as hunters and as scavengers. They eat small animals, including snowshoe hare, mice, rats, woodchucks, beavers, squirrels, snakes, frogs, fish, birds and carrion (animal carcasses). During summer and fall, they also eat grass, fruits and berries.</p>
                    <h3>Life history</h3>
                    <p>The coyote mates between February and April. The female may mate with more than one male. Two months after mating, the female gives birth to between one and nineteen pups. The  average litter size is usually around six. The pups are born blind and with floppy ears. They open their eyes in about ten days.</p>
                    <p>The pups begin to come out of their den when they are about three to four weeks old. They are weaned when they are about a month old. Once they are fully weaned, both parents feed the pups regurgitated food. Male pups will leave their mother when they are between six and nine months old. Female pups will stay with their mother's pack. Male and female coyotes pair off and mate together for several years.</p>
                    <h3>Conservation</h3>
                    <p>Coyotes have quite a stable population throughout the North American continent. The size of the population is continuously multiplying day by day. They have expanded their range from North of the Canada to the South of Mexico. There is no threat that these species are facing nowadays regarding the extinction of their population size. According to the international union for the Conservation of Nature, these are actually the least concerned species on their red list.</p>
                    <p>Being highly adaptable wild animals, coyotes can easily survive in a variety of habitats. Now they are even thriving in the urban and suburban environments of many cities of the world. In 2013, coyotes were actually spotted in the Panama Canal for the first time. It shows that these wild animals are still expanding their range towards the southern side of America.</p>
