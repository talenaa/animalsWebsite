                <h2>Who are the wolves?</h2>
                <p>
                    Wolves (Canis lupus) are members of the Canidae family and can be found across the Northern Hemisphere, in Europe, Asia, and North America. They are often referred to as grey wolves, though there are many recognized subspecies, each with a unique name and found in different habitats. These include the Arctic wolf, the Arabian wolf, and the Iberian wolf.
                    As highly social animals, wolves typically travel and hunt in packs of up to 30 members, targeting large herbivorous animals, such as moose, bison, elk, and oxen as prey. Each pack is led by a dominant alpha male and female. The male is responsible for guiding the pack in its travels, and the female is responsible for caring for and defending the pups.
                </p>

                <p>The dominant pair mate between February and April, with litters of up to five or six pups arriving in the spring. Male wolves weigh 30 to 80 kilograms (65 to 175 pounds) on average and are between 130 and 205 centimeters (4.3 to 6.9 feet) long. Females weigh 23 to 55 kilograms (50 to 120 pounds) and are usually around 20% smaller than males.Wolves are a keystone species and an apex predator in their ecosystems, meaning they help keep the number of prey species—and consequently the fauna and flora these species eat—in check. Because of their environmental importance, conservation and reintroduction projects are underway in certain areas where wolves have been hunted to near extinction.</p>

                <h2>Gray wolf</h2>
                <p>Pervasive in mythology, folklore, and language, the gray wolf has had an impact on the human imagination and has been the victim of levels of misunderstanding that few animals have shared. With the exception of humans and the lion, the gray wolf once had a larger distribution than any other land mammal, once ranging over all of North America from Alaska and Arctic Canada southward to central Mexico and throughout Europe and Asia above 20° N latitude. It lived in every type of habitat except tropical forests and the most arid deserts, and it was the premier hunter of the large hoofed mammals. Several subspecies occur throughout North America, Eurasia, and Africa; however, classifications disagree on the number of wolf subspecies. Wolves were first domesticated in northern Eurasia sometime between 14,000 and 29,000 years ago, and selective breeding produced dogs (C. lupus familiaris).</p>
                <p>The wolf is built for travel. Its long legs, large feet, and deep but narrow chest suit it well for life on the move. Keen senses, large canine teeth, powerful jaws, and the ability to pursue prey at 60 km (37 miles) per hour equip the wolf well for a predatory way of life. A typical northern male may be about 2 metres (6.6 feet) long, including the bushy half-metre-long tail. Standing 76 cm (30 inches) tall at the shoulder, it weighs about 45 kg (100 pounds), but weight ranges from 14 to 65 kg (31 to 143 pounds), depending on the geographic area. Females average about 20 percent smaller than males. The largest wolves are found in west-central Canada, Alaska, and across northern Asia. The smallest tend to be near the southern end of their distribution (the Middle East, Arabia, and India). Fur on the upper body, though usually gray, may be brown, reddish, black, or whitish, while the underparts and legs are usually yellow-white. Light-coloured wolves are common in Arctic regions.</p>
                <p>Early human societies that hunted for survival admired the wolf and tried to imitate its habits, but in recent centuries the wolf has been widely viewed as an evil creature, a danger to humans (especially in Eurasia), a competitor for big game animals, and a threat to livestock. Depredation of livestock was the primary justification for eradicating the wolf from virtually all of the United States, Mexico, and most of Europe. Wolves in the United States were killed by every method imaginable in the 19th and early 20th centuries, and by 1950 they remained only in the northeastern corner of Minnesota.</p>
